# sat

A very simple component based 3D game engine with SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) collision detection, and basic collision resolution made using [jaylib](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib) (raylib bindings for Java) as a practice project to get some experience with Java.

Beware: The project just made as a exercise and is quite incomplete and buggy.

How to run:
- Install Maven
- Run the make command
